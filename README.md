Recycling Reward DApp
Overview
The Recycling Reward DApp incentivizes recycling by issuing eco-tokens for verified recycling activities on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Users can recycle items (verified via QR/NFC), earn eco-tokens, redeem them, or donate to eco-NGOs. The DApp includes fraud prevention, transparent reward algorithms, geo-fencing, and timestamp logging.
Features

Recycle Items: Users submit item IDs with geo-location for verification, earning eco-tokens.
Eco-Token Management: Redeem or donate tokens to eco-NGOs.
Leaderboard: Displays top recyclers based on total recycled items.
Security: Verifiable IDs, geo-fencing, and transparent algorithms prevent fraud.
Optimization: Efficient reward calculation reduces gas costs.
Testing: Comprehensive test suite ensures contract reliability.

Installation

Install Clarinet: npm install -g @hirosystems/clarinet
Clone the repository: git clone <repo-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd recycling-reward-dapp
Start Clarinet: clarinet integrate
Deploy the contract to a local Stacks blockchain for testing.

Usage

Open index.html in a browser with a Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet).
Connect your wallet and interact with the DApp to recycle items, redeem tokens, or donate.
View the leaderboard to see top recyclers.

Testing
Run the test suite with:
clarinet test

The test suite covers recycling, redeeming, donating, and geo-fence validation.
Security Enhancements

Verifiable user IDs via tx-sender.
Geo-fencing ensures recycling occurs within valid coordinates.
Transparent reward algorithms with fixed token issuance.
Post-conditions to verify token balances (implicit in Clarity).
